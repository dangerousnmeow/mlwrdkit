# mlwrdkit
## This repo is the machine learning project based on Chemistry sdf data, need rdkit packages to load. The models used in this project are random forest, support vector machine and graph convolutional neural network
### recent progress:
Loading data âœ”

models based on fingerprints:
Random forest model
Support vector machine model

models based on mol graphs:
Graph convolutional neural network
